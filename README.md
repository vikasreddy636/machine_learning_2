## ABSTRACT

Breast cancer has become one of the prevalent diseases in this era. Many cases are
getting resulted as False Negatives which means that the patients without cancer are
sent to diagnostic mammography, which uses a high dose of X-ray to screen for
cancer which may be harmful to the women, on the other hand, patients with breast
cancer are sent back saying that there is no cancer growth due to the inaccuracy which
results in cancer enormously. In order to overcome this problem, we have designed a
machine learning-based system that can analyze the mammogram output and can
predict whether the patient is developing cancer or not. Unlike the conventional CNN
methods, we have used a unique texture descriptor called LNIP and Radial Basis
Function kernel of the SVM classifier.

## CODE EXECUTION PROCESS
      Download the dataset fom the given link
      `https://unigeit-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/s5061211_studenti_unige_it/Documents/ml2/Dataset_DDSM_database?csf=1&web=1&e=9i1Gm3`
      instead of entire training you can use the pre trained data set which is in the main package addressed LNIP_super_all.csv.
      Clone the complete package from the github link
      ` https://github.com/vikasreddy636/machine_learning_2`
      .git which would have the complete package of the application which we have developed using the python.
      To run the code we should give the command 
      
                                          python3 classification.py

      Once the code input is given for further execution have included the screenshot for reference.

 And for the graphical interface output attached the screenshot for reference

## RESULT
   We have developed this and it can be implemented in the pepper robot architecture that would be helpful for the doctors and technician to give and get  feedback of cancer detection by scanned images.
